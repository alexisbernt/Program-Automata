# Racket-Intro + Web Dev

## Some Definitions 
- Automata = study of computational problems using abstract machines. 
- Programming = computationally telling a computer how to solve problems or carry out functionality and procedures.
- API = Application Programming Interface is a software intermediary that allows two applications to "talk to each other" (share data).
  API will state the rules for how data is communicated/transferred. APIs exist as code, protocols, and interfacesâ€”conceptual (abstract) rather than tangible (physical).
  API - interface that takes request and gives response
  Application provides a service. Web APIs HTTP response (has a response body with information - ex: json, xml, plain text). 
- Hash Table = data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly. 

## Purpose of this repo
Introduction to Racket. Learning Racket Lisp-based Programming Language. Some web development as well.
