# Racket-Intro + Web Dev

## Some Definitions 
- Automata = study of computational problems using abstract machines. 
- Programming = computationally telling a computer how to solve problems or carry out functionality and procedures.
- API = Application Programming Interface is a software intermediary that allows two applications to "talk to each other" (share data).
  API will state the rules for how data is communicated/transferred. APIs exist as code, protocols, and interfaces—conceptual (abstract) rather than tangible (physical).
  API - interface that takes request and gives response
  Application provides a service. Web APIs HTTP response (has a response body with information - ex: json, xml, plain text). 
- Hash Table = data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly.
  You are programming a hash table to save time – you put the hash table within the code (ex: Python dictionary)
  You can generate a hash that will generate an index (stores the key and the value at the index)
- File System = Part of every operating system. Allows for storing and retreiving information. Organized into directories (folders).
  Windows, MacOS, and Linux all have their own file systems.
  Command line can help you navigate your file system
    - Through using commands like cd, grep, ls etc. 
- Network = The interconnection of computing devices. Networks are composed of servers and clients.
    - Server will have the hard drives, printers, and resources shared with other computers on a network.
    - Clients (ex: personal computer, phone, etc.) that request and receive resources from servers.
    - Two types of networks: Public and  private network.
    - Private: Example = intranet
    - Public: Example = internet 

## Purpose of this repo
Introduction to Racket. Learning Racket Lisp-based Programming Language. Some web development as well.
