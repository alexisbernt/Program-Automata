## Plan for "Choose your own adventure" Final Project for Principals of Programming and Automata

Different sides: (1) Racket-based side (2) Web-based side

-------- Initial Scope ------------ All the ideas go here ------------

Feature: React frontend: Will need a main menu, gameboard, map, ascii, avatar on screen, stats, base story for choose your own adventure, timeline of choices, avatar for our toon.

Feature: Racket API: Will need a updated position in map, F.S.S.M (finite sinsuational state machine) (what happens in square), endpoint for API calls, state, character health, character positoom, last choice, history of choices.

Feature: Choose your own adventure: FSM directional, NESW, FSM situational (what happens in square) 

-------- Directional Scope ------------ All the crucial components go here
